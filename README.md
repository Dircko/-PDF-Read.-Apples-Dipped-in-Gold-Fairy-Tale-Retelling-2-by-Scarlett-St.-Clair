Just when she thinks she cannot take another day of their abuse, a handsome prince offers for her hand in marriage. Samara?s brothers agree in exchange for a large dowery but on her way to her new kingdom, her carriage is ambushed by Lore, the wicked Prince of Nightshade. Samara believes that the fae has snatched away her chance at freedom to punish her for her crimes against his kind but punishment is only half of Lore?s plan. The truth is that the Elven Prince has pined after Samara for seven long years. She is all he can think about?a toxin in his blood. Can the Prince of Nightshade, whose power over poisons rivals none in The Enchanted Forest, manage to find a remedy or will he succumb to her love?</p>
